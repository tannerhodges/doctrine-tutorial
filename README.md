# Doctrine Tutorial

### Dependencies:
- [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

### Objective:
Create a [Bug Tracker](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html)
- A bug has a description, creation date, status, reporter and engineer
- A bug can occur on different products (platforms)
- Products have a name.
- Bug Reporter and Engineers are both Users of the System.
- A user can create new bugs.
- The assigned engineer can close a bug.
- A user can see all his reported or assigned bugs.
- Bugs can be paginated through a list-view.

### Debugging:
> Lazy load proxies always contain an instance of Doctrineâ€™s EntityManager and all its dependencies. Therefore a var_dump() will possibly dump a very large recursive structure which is impossible to render and read. You have to use Doctrine\Common\Util\Debug::dump() to restrict the dumping to a human readable level. Additionally you should be aware that dumping the EntityManager to a Browser may take several minutes, and the Debug::dump() method just ignores any occurrences of it in Proxy instances.

### Caching:
- "The recommended cache driver to use with Doctrine is APC." ~ [doctrine-project.org](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/reference/advanced-configuration.html#advanced-configuration)
- [Alternative PHP Cache](http://us1.php.net/apc)
